#Switching Newsletter Plugin-Based Subscriptions to Mailchimp#
Some sites are using The Newsletter Plugin to allow users to subscribe to their blog. We want to standarize on MailChimp, so we need to help those sites move to Mailchimp to handle their blog subscriptions.

See Switching a WordPress Site From Jetpack-Based Subscriptions to Mailchimp for information on how to help Site Admins make this change.
