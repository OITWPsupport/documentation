Scripts n Styles: Using Hoops to create an iframe shortcode
Because WordPress prevents users from adding iframes to their Posts, Super Administrators have to maintain any pages that require iframes. This procedure describes how to use the Scripts n Styles plugin to create shortcodes that will allow your users to publish iframes.

Iframes are not the best way to add content to your page. The look, behavior and accessibility of the iframed content is out of your control, and your site’s usability is often diminished as a result of using an iframe. Instead, add the desired content to your page, or link to the site where it’s published. If that’s not possible, follow these instructions to create a shortcode to implement the iframe you need.

As a Super Administrator...

1. Go to the site-level Dashboard.
2. Click Plugins.
3. Find Scripts n Styles, and click Settings.
4. Click the Hoops tab.
5. Use the forms on this page to create or edit Hoops for the iframes you want to include in your Pages and your Posts.
6. For any Hoops you create, communicate the shortcode to your Authors and Editors so they can add it to their Posts as necessary.

As an Author or Editor...

1. Create or edit a Post.
2. Add the Hoops shortcode to the Post where you want the iframe to appear.

You won’t have the ability to change the content of the Hoop. You’ll need the Super Administrator to edit the Hoop (or create a new one) if you need a different iframe.
