# Audience

This document is for use by OIT's WP Support team. Creating and configuring a Woocommerce site is fairly technical, so the content here isn't useful to site admins.

# Description

Woocommerce (woocommerce.com) is a shopping cart plugin that allows site admins to create and sell products on a WordPress site. Woocommerce is OIT’s only supported shopping cart. 

Woocommerce handles inventory and the user's shopping experience. Payment gateways, such as uPay and PayPal, process the payments. Woocommerce extensions are available to support various payment gateways. The university’s only approved payment gateway is Touchnet uPay. 

In several cases on campus, Woocommerce is useful without a payment gateway; it can stand alone and serve as a shopping cart to allow users to order free items or download digital materials. (See radarcart.boisestate.edu and oshconcart.boisestate.edu.)
